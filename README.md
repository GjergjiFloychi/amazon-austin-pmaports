Armv7l
Mediatek MT8127

600x1024 display
1GB RAM
Linux 3.10.54

What seems to work:

Boot

OTG usb
Wayland, Mate, Xfce4, Lxde, Sxmo, i3wm

Does NOT work:

Wifi & Bluetooth (no drivers)
GPU acceleration (drivers do not work)
Audio

Screen rotation
Wifi adapter does not work even with drivers and kernel support, mobo support issue(?)
FDE

You tell me

Special options:
*Must be flashed to USERDATA partition as system partition is too small

msm-fb-refresher must be installed when building rootfs for the display to refresh
After flashing the device must be booted into recovery once. From the recovery it is to be powered off and booted and then as normal. This is because the device depends on the AMONET exploit which is applied by twrp after every flash.
